# My Project was an attempt at creating a home page for a travel agcency. I attempted to use javascript to create a sign up form; however, my website went south and some of my css stopped working despite not changing any of the code. The attributes that I used in my website are a hover transition, responsive menu with CSS, and running the page through PageSpeed Insights.
